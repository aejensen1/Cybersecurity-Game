Cybersentries: The Quest for AI

Last update: 2-24-2024

This was originally a capstone research and development project for my Honors course in college, but I aim to update the game periodically. The game is designed as a 2-dimensional top-down adventure video game that is both engaging and educational, providing a fundamental and important understanding of cybersecurity. The game could be played by a person at any experience in cybersecurity and requires intermediate understanding of how to use a computer for games.
